# Week 4

[Hours](https://github.com/alanenpa/Connect-Four/blob/main/Documentation/Reports/Hours.md)

## What I did
- Complete the first version of board scoring method
- Began sketching the pickBestMove-method with the ability to choose depth

## Problems
I couldn't picture what would be the best way to implement the method for best move picking with depth

## Next week
- Add minus points to board scoring method (if opp is winning)
- Finish pickBestMove-method
- Refactoring
