# Week 4 and 5

[Hours](https://github.com/alanenpa/Connect-Four/blob/main/Documentation/Reports/Hours.md)

## What I did
- Didn't have time for the project on week 4. Running late on the course schedule.
- Fixed some Checkstyle errors
- Created Location and Node classes
- Created first version of minimax algorithm
- Refactored the game to use a smaller grid
- Changed the game to a player vs. computer, computer chooses randomly yet

## Problems
I couldn't quite picture how to implement the algorithm yet, still lots of learning to do.

## Next week
- Implement minimax
- Fix Checkstyle errors
