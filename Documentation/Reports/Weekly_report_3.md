# Week 3

[Hours](https://github.com/alanenpa/Connect-Four/blob/main/Documentation/Reports/Hours.md)

## What I did
- Wrote Javadocs to everything
- Lots of refactoring, created Board and Referee classes
- Created method for win checking
- Created tests for Board class, refactoring probably still needed there
- Migrated build configuration from Kotlin to Groovy because of poor documentation
- Configured Jacoco and Checkstyle for the project

## Problems
Migrating from Kotlin to Groovy wasn't that straightforward, neither was configuring Jacoco and Checkstyle.
Eventually got it all working.

## Next week
- Creating the first version of minimax
- More tests
- Fix Checkstyle errors
- Refactoring
