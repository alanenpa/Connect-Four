# Week 1

[Hours](https://github.com/alanenpa/Connect-Four/blob/main/Documentation/Reports/Hours.md)

## What I did
- Gave up on using a Board object as this would probably cause problems later
- Refactored all Board object methods to class methods in App.java
- Improved significantly the win checking method in efficiency. The method now checks the win only related
  the last move, and not the whole board
- Refactored all tests to use the class methods and the new improved win checking

## Problems
Implementation of the fast win checking method wasn't that straightforward

## Next week
- Create method to score a game situation
