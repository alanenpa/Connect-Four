# Week 1

## What I did
- Installed a new JDK to get everything working.
- Decided not to create the UI with JavaFX. Command line interface will be much straight to the point.
- Migrated to IntelliJ. Configured Gradle there.
- Finally got the project started.
- Created a basic Connect Four game structure. The second player will eventually be replaced with the algorithm.

## Problems
VS Code couldn't detect my JDK in WSL no matter what I tried. Decided to continue development natively on Windows.
Uninstalled all my JDKs and installed a fresh one to eventually get it working. Configuring Kotlin-based build.gradle file was confusing at first.

## Next week
- Refactoring a lot
- Writing Javadocs after refactoring
- Creating tests and implementing some test coverage tool
- Creating the first version of minimax
