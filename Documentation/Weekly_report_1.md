# Week 1

## What I did
- Project creation
- Setting up version control
- Studying setting up Gradle project with JavaFX on WSL
- Studying minimax algorithm

## Problems
I couldn't get even the most basic JavaFX application to run on WSL (error message: Unable to open DISPLAY). Google offered to little to no help.

## Next week
- Sorting out the configurations to get the actual project started
- Some primitive GUI and functionality
